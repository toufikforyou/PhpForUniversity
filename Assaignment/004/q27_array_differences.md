# Question 27: Indexed Arrays vs Associative Arrays

| Feature | Indexed Arrays | Associative Arrays |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key Type** | Keys are integers (automatically assigned starting from 0). | Keys are named strings (user-defined). |
| **Access** | Elements are accessed by their numeric index. | Elements are accessed by their named key. |
| **Example** | `$colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];` <br> Access: `$colors[0]` | `$age = ["Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=>"37"];` <br> Access: `$age['Peter']` |
